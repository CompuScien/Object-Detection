Object detection is one of the foremost vital and challenging areas of computer vision and is connected to many applications, like autonomous driving, robotics, face recognition, monitoring traffic, human behavior analysis, medical image processing for healthcare, and etc. As one of the essential problems of computer vision, object detection can provide valuable information for the semantic grasp of images and videos. With the quick development of deep learning algorithms specially after 2012 and AlexNet for computer vision and detection tasks, the performance of object detectors has been greatly improved.
